# Doppio Changelog

## v0.2.0

*2020-12-25*

### Added

* CGI local redirects now work, up to a configurable limit. These redirects are handled internally to the server, and do not produce responses to clients.
* The CGI variables PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED are now set.

### Changed

* The server keystore and keystore password are now set in the server properties file, instead of through Java system properties.
* The server truststore and truststore password are also now set in the server properties file, instead of through Java system properties.
* The CGI variable SERVER_SOFTWARE includes the server version.
* In accordance with Gemini protocol v0.14.3, the "gemini" scheme is now required on URIs.

### Fixed

* Some missing license headers in the source code are in place.
* Most issues found by PMD are addressed.

### Security

* The length of a request is limited to 1026 bytes (1024 bytes for the request string itself, plus 2 more for CRLF). This protects against the use of extremely long request lines.
* All request URIs (i.e., those passed in from clients and those generated by CGI local redirects) are normalized before processing. This protects against the use of ".." path segments to escape the server root.
